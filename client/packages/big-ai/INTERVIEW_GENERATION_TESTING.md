# Interview Generation Testing

Use this guide to verify that `/interview` gathers enough information before it generates a UML class diagram.

## 1. Static Check

Run the package checks:

```sh
npm run compile --workspace @borkdominik-biguml/big-ai
npm run lint --workspace @borkdominik-biguml/big-ai
```

Both commands should complete without errors.

## 2. Manual VS Code Extension Test

Run the extension in development mode. In the Extension Development Host, open Copilot Chat and address the `@biguml` participant.

Start with:

```text
@biguml /interview Create a UML diagram for a library borrowing system.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent asks clarifying questions.
- It does not create a file.
- It does not create a diagram.

Continue with:

```text
It should include Member, Book, and Loan.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent asks about relationships.

Then provide relationships:

```text
A Member has many Loans. A Loan references one Book.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent eventually shows a summary similar to:

```text
Summary
- Diagram file:
- Scope:
- Entities:
- Relationships:
- Details:
- Assumptions:
- Missing information:

Reply "generate" to create the diagram, or provide corrections.
```

Before this summary, the agent must not call:

- `biguml-create-uml-file`
- `biguml-add-node`
- `biguml-add-relation`

Confirm generation:

```text
generate
```

Expected behavior:

- Tool calls are now allowed.
- If a file path was provided, the agent creates the `.uml` file.
- The agent adds nodes and relations using tools.

## Useful Negative Tests

### Direct Entity List

Try:

```text
@biguml /interview Generate a diagram for Order, Customer, Product.
```

Expected behavior:

- No generation happens yet.
- The agent asks clarifying questions or produces a summary that requires confirmation.

### Deployment Diagram

Try:

```text
@biguml /interview Create a deployment diagram for a cloud system.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent asks clarifying questions about nodes (Devices, Execution Environments) and communication paths.
- The summary should correctly identify the diagram type as `DEPLOYMENT`.
- After confirmation, it should call `biguml-generate-deployment-diagram`.

### Unsupported Diagram Type

Try:

```text
@biguml /interview Create a sequence diagram for login.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent explains that AI-assisted generation currently supports UML class diagrams only.

### Hallucination Pressure

Try:

```text
@biguml /interview Create a complete ecommerce model with everything you think is needed.
```

Expected behavior:

- The agent does not invent a full model.
- The agent asks scope, entity, or relationship questions.

## Where To Inspect Logs

Open the `big-ai` output channel in VS Code.

Before confirmation, the logs should include lines like:

```text
[big-ai] Interview phase: scope
[big-ai] Generation confirmed: false
```

Before confirmation, only `readUmlFile` should be available.

After confirmation, the logs should include:

```text
[big-ai] Interview phase: generation
[big-ai] Generation confirmed: true
```

At that point, generation tool calls may appear.
